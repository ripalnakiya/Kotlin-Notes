# Inheritance

All classes in Kotlin have a common superclass, `Any`, which is the default superclass for a class with no supertypes declared:

```Kotlin
class Example // Implicitly inherits from Any
```

`Any` has three methods: `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()`. Thus, these methods are defined for all Kotlin classes.

By default, Kotlin classes are final â€“ they can't be inherited. To make a class inheritable, mark it with the `open` keyword:

```Kotlin
open class Base // Class is open for inheritance
```

To declare an explicit supertype, place the type after a colon in the class header:

```Kotlin
open class Base

class Derived : Base
class Derived() : Base      // This also works fine
```

```Kotlin
open class Base(p: Int)

class Derived(p: Int) : Base(p)
```

If the derived class has a primary constructor, the base class can (and must) be initialized in that primary constructor according to its parameters.

If the derived class has no primary constructor, then each secondary constructor has to initialize the base constructor using the `super` keyword, or it has to delegate to another constructor which does. 

```Kotlin
open class Base(name: String) {
    constructor(name: String, rollNumber: Number) : this(name) {
        // TODO
    }
}

class Derived: Base {
    constructor(name: String) : super(name) {
        // TODO
    }

    constructor(name: String, rollNumber: Number) : super(name, rollNumber) {
        // TODO
    }

    // Delegate to another constructor which initialises the base class constructor
    constructor(name: String, rollNumber: Number, department: String) : this(name) {
        // TODO
    }
}

```

Note that in this case different secondary constructors can call different constructors of the base type:

```Kotlin
class MyView : View {
    constructor(ctx: Context) : super(ctx)

    constructor(ctx: Context, attrs: AttributeSet) : super(ctx, attrs)
}
```

## Overriding methods

Kotlin requires explicit modifiers for **overridable members** and **overrides**:

```Kotlin
open class Shape {
    open fun draw() { /*...*/ }
    fun fill() { /*...*/ }
}

class Circle() : Shape() {
    override fun draw() { /*...*/ }
}
```

If there is no `open` modifier on a function, like `Shape.fill()`, declaring a method with the same signature in a subclass is not allowed, either with `override` or without it. 

The `open` modifier has no effect when added to members of a final class.

A member marked `override` is itself `open`, so it may be overridden in subclasses. 

If you want to prohibit re-overriding, use `final`:

```Kotlin
open class Rectangle() : Shape() {
    final override fun draw() { /*...*/ }
}
```

## Overriding properties

The overriding mechanism works on properties in the same way that it does on methods. 

Properties declared on a superclass that are then redeclared on a derived class must be prefaced with `override`, and they must have a compatible type. 

Each declared property can be overridden by a property with an initializer or by a property with a get method:

```Kotlin
open class Shape {
    open val vertexCount: Int = 0
}

class Rectangle : Shape() {
    override val vertexCount = 4
    // OR
    override val vertexCount: Int
        get() = 4
}
```

You can also override a `val` property with a `var` property, but not vice versa.

This is allowed because a `val` property essentially declares a `get` method, and overriding it as a `var` additionally declares a `set` method in the derived class.

Note that you can use the override keyword as part of the property declaration in a primary constructor:

```Kotlin
interface Shape {
    val vertexCount: Int
}

class Rectangle(override val vertexCount: Int = 4) : Shape 
// Always has 4 vertices

class Polygon : Shape {
    override var vertexCount: Int = 0  
    // Can be set to any number later
}
```

## Derived class initialization order

During the construction of a new instance of a derived class, the base class initialization is done as the first step (preceded only by evaluation of the arguments for the base class constructor), which means that it happens before the initialization logic of the derived class is run.

```Kotlin
open class Base(val name: String) {

    init { println("Initializing a base class") }

    open val size: Int = 
        name.length.also { println("Initializing size in the base class: $it") }
}

class Derived(
    name: String,
    val lastName: String,
) : Base(name.replaceFirstChar { it.uppercase() }.also { println("Argument for the base class: $it") }) {

    init { println("Initializing a derived class") }

    override val size: Int =
        (super.size + lastName.length).also { println("Initializing size in the derived class: $it") }
}

// Output:
Argument for the base class: Hello
Initializing a base class
Initializing size in the base class: 5
Initializing a derived class
Initializing size in the derived class: 10
```

This means that when the base class constructor is executed, the properties declared or overridden in the derived class have not yet been initialized.

Using any of those properties in the base class initialization logic (either directly or indirectly through another overridden open member implementation) may lead to incorrect behavior or a runtime failure. 

When designing a base class, you should therefore avoid using open members in the constructors, property initializers, or init blocks.

```Kotlin
open class Robot {
    open val name: String = "Basic Robot"
    
    init {
        introduce()
    }
    
    open fun introduce() {
        println("Hello, I am $name!")
    }
}

class DancingRobot : Robot() {
    override val name: String = "Dancing Robot"
    
    override fun introduce() {
        println("Hi there! I am $name and I love to dance!")
    }
}

fun main() {
    var obj = DancingRobot()
    obj.introduce()
}

// Output:
Hi there! I am null and I love to dance!
Hi there! I am Dancing Robot and I love to dance!
```

## Calling the superclass implementation

Code in a derived class can call its superclass functions and property accessor implementations using the `super` keyword:

```Kotlin
open class Rectangle {
    open fun draw() { println("Drawing a rectangle") }
    val borderColor: String get() = "black"
}

class FilledRectangle : Rectangle() {
    override fun draw() {
        super.draw()
        println("Filling the rectangle")
    }

    val fillColor: String get() = super.borderColor
}
```

Inside an inner class, accessing the superclass of the outer class is done using the super keyword qualified with the outer class name `super@Outer`:

```Kotlin
class FilledRectangle: Rectangle() {
    override fun draw() {
        val filler = Filler()
        filler.drawAndFill()
    }

    inner class Filler {
        fun fill() { println("Filling") }
        fun drawAndFill() {
            // Calls Rectangle's implementation of draw()
            super@FilledRectangle.draw()
            
            fill()
        }
    }
}
```

## Overriding rules

In Kotlin, implementation of inheritance is regulated by the following rule: 
if a class inherits multiple implementations of the same member from its immediate superclasses, it must override this member and provide its own implementation (perhaps, using one of the inherited ones).

To denote the supertype from which the inherited implementation is taken, use super qualified by the supertype name in angle brackets, such as `super<Base>`:

```Kotlin
open class Rectangle {
    open fun draw() { /* ... */ }
}

interface Polygon {
    fun draw() { /* ... */ } // interface members are 'open' by default
}

class Square() : Rectangle(), Polygon {
    // The compiler requires draw() to be overridden:
    override fun draw() {
        super<Rectangle>.draw() // call to Rectangle.draw()
        super<Polygon>.draw() // call to Polygon.draw()
    }
}
```

It's fine to inherit from both Rectangle and Polygon, but both of them have their implementations of draw(), so you need to override draw() in Square and provide a separate implementation for it to eliminate the ambiguity.
